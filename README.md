# Fashion Alley - Fullstack Next.js E-commerce Site

## About The Project :thought_balloon:

---

<br />

This project is an e-commerce site built using Next.js for both front-end and back-end. Please check out [Technologies](#technologies-ðŸ”§) and [Features](#features-âš¡) for more information.
<br>
The purpose of this project is to not only learn Next.js but also deepen my understanding about PostgreSQL, Server-side rendering, SEO, Service Workers / PWA, and Caching.
<br>
The design is made by me after surveying the UI of many different e-commerce sites.
<br>
Visit [Future Plans](#future-plans) section to see what I plan to add to this repo in the near future.

_Note: The products shown on this website is not my own creation. They are from another e-commerce site._

## Issues

---

<br />

- Customer default address cannot be forwarded to Stripe Checkout as they do not offer pre-filled address on the first checkout.
- Address used during checkout process is currently not saved to the database under the user's account.
- Most links in the footer are dead-ended, as well as the 'Forgot Password?' link.
- Product descriptions an details are sample texts except for T-shirts and Blouses categories.

## Future Plans

---

<br />

- Change user default address based on latest invoice shipping address and move the previous default address to 'Other Addresses'
- Enable customer to create one or more wishlist collections
- Add comment / review section and rating for products
- Paginate catalog, category, and search pages
- Enable customer to change name and other credentials
- Add functionality to the 'Forgot Password?' link
- Testing using Jest
- Docker
